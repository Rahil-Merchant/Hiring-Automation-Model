Using data of students appying to a company for internships, this project strives to get insights and draw out meaningful conclusions. A data visualization model is built along with a data segmentation model using this dataset of the applicants' profiles. 

Tasts Performed:
• Preprocessed the data for missing values, unknown values, encoding categorical 
values. 
• Created a data visualization model to build graphs from the dataset answering the following 
questions: 

  o The number of students applied to different technologies. 
  
  o The number of students applied for Data Science who knew ‘’Python” and who didn’t.
  
  o The different ways students learned about this program. 
  
  o Students who are in the fourth year and have a CGPA greater than 8.0. 
  
  o Students who applied for Digital Marketing with verbal and written communication 
  score higher than 8. 
  
  o Year-wise and area of study wise classification of students. 
  
  o City and college wise classification of students. 
  
  o Plot the relationship between the CGPA and the target variable. 
  
  o Plot the relationship between the Area of Interest and the target variable. 
  
  o Plot the relationship between the year of study, major, and the target variable. 
  
• Identify the best binary classifier to classify data into “eligible/1” and “not eligible/0”
